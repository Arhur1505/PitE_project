# Hill Climb Racing-Inspired Game

A simple game inspired by **Hill Climb Racing**, written in Python using the Pygame library.

## About the Project

This project is a game based on the popular *Hill Climb Racing*, with additional integration of **Reinforcement Learning** using OpenAI Gym. The aim is to combine traditional game mechanics with AI-driven decision-making to create an engaging and dynamic experience.

## Features

- Developed using **Python** and **Pygame**.
- Implements **Reinforcement Learning** algorithms for autonomous gameplay.
- Physics-based mechanics for realistic vehicle behavior.
- Designed for experimentation and learning in AI and game development.
